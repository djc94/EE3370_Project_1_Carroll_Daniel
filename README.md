EE 3370 Project 1 (Daniel Carroll)


This is Daniel Carroll's EE3370 Project 1. 
MATLAB code and my MATLAB folder will not commit through SVN client. 

Instead I have committed a new .m file to my repository directly through Github.com. 
I could not figure out how to create a new folder this way, so the Matlab code is in my repository's main trunk folder.
